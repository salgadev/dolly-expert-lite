The guidelines for commercial buildings are defined in the Ontario Building Code, R.S.O. 1990, Reg. 250, and also available in Book 2, Chapter 2, Section 2.7 and Appendix 2 for guidelines on commercial spaces. The accessible design principles, requirements and guidelines outlined in these documents should assist in the construction of barrier-free commercial buildings. A basic understanding of the principles, requirements and guidelines outlined is required. A comprehensive guide is available on the web. It is recommended to review the web site for details of the barrier-free guidelines by using the acronym FAR (Federal Accessibility Recommendation) and state codes where applicable. For example, where a federal mandate is applicable, the ACM (Access and Coordination Modules). It is also recommended that there is an accessible elevator and that there is a clear path for the wheelchair lift to direct the wheelchair along.\n",

Where required by the OBC, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms must be permanently connected to an electrical circuit and have no disconnect switch between the overcurrent device and the alarm. 2. Where required, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms must be wired such that their activation will activate all alarms within the suite. 3. Where required, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms must be equipped with an alarm that is audible within bedrooms when the intervening doors are closed. 4. Where required, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms must conform to the requirements of Canadian Standards Association (CSA) document 619, \"Residential Carbon Monoxide Alarming Devices\". 5. Where applicable, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms must conform to the requirements of Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) standard 2034, \"Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms\". These regulations apply to the residential building as a whole, including individual suites. Individual suites are defined as rooms within a residential building that are physically distinct spaces separated by a common entrance area\n",
